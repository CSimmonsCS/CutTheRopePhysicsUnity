# CutTheRopePhysicsUnity
This project uses C# &amp; Unity to replicate the physics used for the popular mobile game "Cut The Rope".  There are hooks in which rope hangs from that are connected to a weight.  The ropes consist of links that hang from each other to form a rope.  The user can cut the rope by clicking on a link.  Doing so will separate the rope and "cut" the link from where was clicked. After, the rope &amp; weight then have 2D physics applied.  Enjoy!
